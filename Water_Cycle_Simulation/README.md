# Camera Movements by Keyboard Keys

##### Instructions to run the program:-

'X' to decrease cameraPosition[0] value which is the cameras position around x axis'x' to increase cameraPosition[0] value which is the cameras position around x axis'Y' to decrease cameraPosition[1] value which is the cameras position around y axis'y' to increase cameraPosition[1] value which is the cameras position around y axis'Z' to decrease cameraPosition[2] value which is the cameras position around z axis'z' to increase cameraPosition[2] value which is the cameras position around z axis


# Animations are done on
